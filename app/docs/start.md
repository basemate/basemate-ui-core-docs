## Current State
This project is currently under heavy development and should not be used until the
first tested, stable version is released. Please use it only after being
onboarded by the basemate team. Feel free to reach out if you really can't
wait to start :)

First stable release is scheduled for mid October 2018.

## Our why:
Frontend development has gotten unnecessarily complex, messy and expensive. Implementing responsive, basic user interfaces often keeps us from creating the really valuable juice (= business logic).

## Our how:
We're replacing the original view-layer of Ruby on Rails, the most productive MVC framework we know, with our technology. By introducing basemate we get dynamic, fast and simple user interfaces without the need to touch HTML/HAML/ERB/JS/CSS. Plus, it feels like a single page application, but there's no need for all the API hustle SPAs usually bring with them.

## Our what:
Escape the frontend hustle. Create beautiful software easily. Use basemate.
