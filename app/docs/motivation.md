##Our why:
Frontend development has gotten unnecessarily complex, messy and expensive. Implementing responsive, basic user interfaces often keeps us from creating the really valuable juice (= business logic).
## Our how:
We're replacing the original view-layer of Ruby on Rails, the most productive MVC framework we know, with our technology. By introducing basemate we get dynamic, fast and simple user interfaces without the need to touch HTML/HAML/ERB/JS/CSS. Plus, it feels like a single page application, but there's no need for all the API hustle SPAs usually bring with them.
## Our what:
Escape the frontend hustle. Create beautiful software easily. Use basemate.
