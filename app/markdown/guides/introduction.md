## What is basemate?
**basemate = Rails + Vue.js**

basemate is a Rails Engine, turning the MVC-Framework Ruby on Rails into a
Fullstack Web-Development Framework. With basemate you are able to write dynamic
Web-Apps in pure Ruby. Javascript/HTML/CSS is only used for adding special, custom
UI-Behaviour.

basemate is designed to write maintainable, dynamic Web-UIs on top of Rails and Vue.js with
minimum effort. In order to increase development speed, basemate's architecture
moves back- and frontend development closer together. In other words: basemate
melts Rails and Vue.js down to one holistic Web App Development Framework.

basemate progressively replaces the classic Rails-View-Layer. You are able to use
it alongside your classic views and incrementally turn your Rails-App into a
dynamic, more maintainable Web-App.

## Why basemate?

We loved Rails and we loved how simple it was, to create applications using just Rails.
Nowadays, Web Apps often have to be dynamic. Users don't enjoy static
request/response Websites with constant full page reloads. They are used to native
Apps and the so called "App-feeling". Rails doesn't serve you well here.

So we started to create fullblown Javascript applications and reduced Rails to a pure JSON API.
Now we got that dynamic "App-feeling" on our UIs but increased the complexity in
our development. Implementing two separate systems (backend-api, frontent-app) is a
pain: two deployments, two test environments, two frameworks, two everything...!

This sophisticated architecture offers a lot of flexibility and possibilites how
to extend your systems, sure! But you know what? We didn't need that flexibility! In 90%
of our projects, we just had to create a straight forward app for a small to medium-size
company but ended up setting up an architecture which would be suitable for big enterprises.

So we made a step back and rethought the way we implemented software. We thought
about the biggest pains we had while creating modern Web UIs. We called it the
"frontend hustle". We realized that we still love most concepts of Rails, we just
were missing a good approach to easily define a maintainable, dynamic UI deeply
integrated into Rails. So we invented basemate!

We made basemate for us. We already use it in our daily business and we love it. We want to
share our approach with all other developers and improve the architecture in a
community of mates! So if you're with us:

Escape the frontend hustle. Create maintainable, dynamic and beautiful UIs easily. Use basemate.

## How does it work?

Let's have a look on how following dynamic UI is implemented in basemate:
