## Basic Building Blocks

basemate's UI concept consists of three major building blocks: "component", "page" and "app".
A component is a reusable UI-Element. A page contains multiple components
and represents the main content on a specific view. Multiple
pages can be wrapped in an app, sharing a layout for example.
