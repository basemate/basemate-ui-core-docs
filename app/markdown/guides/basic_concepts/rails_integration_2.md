As you can see, a HTTP request is processed similarly as in the classic Rails
MVC architecture. In contrast to the classic approach, the HTML Rendering is now
handled inside a basemate page, which uses components to render HTML. You can
decide on each action, if you want to use a classic Rails view or a basemate page!
