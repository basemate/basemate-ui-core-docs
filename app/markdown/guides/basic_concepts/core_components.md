## Core Components

Core components are shipped within Matestack::Ui::Core. These components are used across
all kind of Web-Apps. A lot of the core components simply represents HTML tags, such
as "div","span" and so on. This enables you to create your UI as flexibel as if
you were doing it with classic HTML, despite you're writing pure Ruby. Some other
core components such as "action" or "transition" already add basic dynamic features,
such as asynchronously performing a backend-action without writing your own JS or
exchange page content without a page reload like a SPA would do it.
