# Core Usage Dummy App - Sprockets Approach

This app demonstrates the simplest approach to use Basemate::Ui::Core without any bundle or theme in charge. Assets are compiled and served only with sprockets. Webpacker is not installed. This makes it very easy to integrate without any further dependencies. It is not recommend if you want to extend Basemate through building your own components; you should use Webpacker instead.
